# Interchain Foundation Funding Program
  
The Interchain Foundation (ICF) has a broad mandate to support 
the development of open-source decentralized networks. This 
repository contains information about topics eligible for 
support, application instructions, our review process, and a 
record of funded projects.

## Request for Proposals

The Interchain Foundation invites individuals, companies and 
institutions to submit proposals within the following categories. 
Each category contains a non-exhaustive list of topics, any of 
which could provide the basis for a successful funding proposal.

- [Research](./RFP-research.md)
- [Engineering & Product](./RFP-engineering_and_product.md)
- [Social Good & Community](./RFP-social_good_and_community.md)

## How to Apply

1. Familiarize yourself with the 
[ICF Mission & Vision](https://interchain.io/mission/) and our
current [Request for Proposals](#request-for-proposals) to assess
whether your proposal is aligned with the Interchain Foundation's
mandate and quarterly objectives.
2. Complete the application form at [apply.interchain.io](https://apply.interchain.io).
Be sure to include a complete description of the proposed work, 
[budget & timeline](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pq4C8ne_OhTzAZeMIHgZDGkjpq8LLyUZN4DpM65oRRk/),
otherwise we cannot consider your application.
3. An email receipt will be sent upon submission,
your application will be [reviewed](#review-process), and you 
will be contacted as soon as the Interchain Founation has 
made a determination.

## Review Process

All applications are reviewed by the Interchain Foundation as well by external parties within the various **Granting Entities** and the **Technical Advisory Board**. Throughout the process additional information may be requested. Find details about the review process [here](./review_process.md).

We often work with applicants to revise their proposed scope to 
ensure success and better meet the needs of the ecosystem.

## Funding Types

Financing Agreements between Applicants and the Interchain Foundation can be of the following types:
 * **Service Agreement** - This type is the most common, with payments based on clear fulfillment of deliverables.
 * **Grants** - This type of financing is preferred if deliverables are less discrete, if proposed work is part of an ongoing process or multi-stakeholder system where ICF oversight will have little effect on the outcome.
 * **Investment** - This is the least common type and occurs when there is exceptional alignment between a project and the Interchain Foundation's Mission and Vision.
