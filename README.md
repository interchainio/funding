# Interchain Foundation Funding Program
  
The Interchain Foundation (ICF) has a broad mandate to support 
the development of open-source decentralized networks. This 
repository contains information about topics eligible for 
support, application instructions, our review process, and a 
record of funded projects.

## Request for Proposals

The Interchain Foundation invites individuals, companies, 
institutions, or alternative organizational bodies with a payable 
address to submit proposals within the following categories. 
Each category contains a non-exhaustive list of topics, any of 
which could provide the basis for a sucessful funding proposal.

- [Social Good & Community](./social_good_and_community.md)
- [Research](./research.md)
- [Engineering & Product](./engineering_and_product.md)

## How to Apply

1. Familiarize yourself with the 
[ICF Mission & Vision](https://interchain.io/mission/) and our
current [Request for Proposals](#request-for-proposals) to assess
whether your proposal is aligned with the Interchain Foundation's
mandate and quarterly objectives.
2. Complete the application form [here](TBD), be sure to include
a complete description of the proposed work, budget, and timeline,
otherwise we cannot consider your application.
3. An email receipt will be sent upon submission,
your application will be [reviewed](#review-process), and you 
will be contacted as soon as the Interchain Founation has 
made a determination.

## Review Process

All applications undergo a [review process](./review_process.md) 
throughout which additional information may be requested.

We often work with applicants to revise their proposed scope to 
ensure success and better meet the needs of the ecosystem.
