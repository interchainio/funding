The ICF engaged ZondaX to build the Ledger Nano S application for Cosmos, which allows ATOM holders to better protect their assets with a secure certified hardware wallet. ZondaX has also made a number of [contributions](https://github.com/ZondaX/cosmos-sdk) to the Cosmos-SDK code base.
 
**4. Tony Arcieri -** [**https://github.com/tendermint/kms**](https://github.com/tendermint/kms)

**Type of Funding: Service Agreement**

**Category: Engineering**

**TLDR: Built a Key Management System for Validators**
 
The ICF engaged Tony Arcieri to build the key management system; the highest level critical infrastructure for the validators who operate the Cosmos Network. The KMS communicates with Tendermint to provide information needed from private keys without ever touching the private key material. This tool adds defense to Tendermint, and makes it harder for malicious actors to gain access to private keys. The software is built in Rust and as part of this implementation, a library called Signatory was also built. Signatory allows for signing using many different kinds of back ends; Rust library, YubiHSM,  LedgerNano, etc. 
 
**5. Professor Chiessa, University of California at Berkeley** [**http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alexch/**](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alexch/)

**Type of Funding: Grant**

**Category: Research**

**TLDR: Zero Knowledge Proof research for blockchain scalability and IBC security**
 
The ICF funded Professor Allesandro Chiessa at University of Berkeley to support his research around zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) and blockchain applications to advance the science of proof-carrying data.  Two of the popular projects that Professor Chiessa is currently working on are Aurora and Zexe: Aurora is a new system for zero-knowledge proofs, and Zexe is a new design for scalable decentralized private computation.
 
This research around the zero-knowledge proofs and approach to cryptography will extend the applications of digital signatures and will be important for general blockchain scalability.  This research may be application to Cosmos’ Interblockchain Communication (IBC) in particular, as ZKP integrations into IBC could strengthen IBC assurances between Hubs. Further, this research will be important for private businesses that want to build on top of Cosmos, who require privacy of transactions. 
Dev Ojha, a prolific contributor and previous intern at All In Bits,  is working to further Chiesa’s research while completing his undergraduate degree.
 
 
**6. Stanford Center for Blockchain Research** [**https://cbr.stanford.edu/**](https://cbr.stanford.edu/)

**Type of Funding: Grant**

**Category: Research**

**TLDR: Founded a Center for Blockchain Research at Stanford with other major blockchain organizations to advance the state-of-the-art in cryptography and its applications.**
 
The Interchain Foundation was a founding member of The Center for Blockchain Research (CBR) at Stanford University. Part of the funding went to support professors/faculty scholars in the Department of Computer Science, while the largest proportion went to the CBR directly to  advance research and education related to blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies, as well as their economic, social, and legal impact.
 
The CBR is working on many different areas of cryptographic research. In particular, Dan Boneh has been focusing on BLS signature research. This research will have a massive impact on blockchain scalability and may be used to  make Tendermint more scalable.

The ICF funded LedgerWatch  to work on Ethermint and provide strategic guidance on incorporating techniques from Turbogeth into the database layer of the Cosmos SDK. Many of the techniques used in TurboGeth ( ex. how state is stored and low-level database engineering/optimizations), were applicable to improving the design of the Cosmos SDK.
 
**8. Althea** [**https://althea.org/**](https://althea.org/)

**Type of Funding: Investment**

**Category: Product**

**TLDR: Using Cosmos for incentivized mesh networks in local communities.**
 
The ICF participated in a financing round for Althea. Althea is creating  a network that allows  internet routers pay each other for bandwidth, with the intent of decentralizing and democratizing internet access by allowing people to set up local mesh networks using commonly available, high bandwidth wireless equipment. Althea allows the people running the equipment to earn money for their contribution to the network without requiring a centralized ISP business to collect payments.
 
If successful, Althea will build a decentralized alternative to centralized ISPs. To date, Althea's software has been prototyped in Solidity, but the team is planning to deploy on a Cosmos zone to meet the real-world scalability needs of internet infrastructure.  All Althea blockchain code (payments and governance) will run on this Cosmos zone.
 
The ICF will occasionally make equity investments in teams we believe in that are building on Cosmos, and who are likely to have a strong impact on both the Cosmos ecosystem. 

**9. IRIS** [**https://www.theiris.org/**](https://www.theiris.org/)

**Type of Funding: Investment**

**Category: Engineering**

**TLDR: A regional Cosmos Hub in China.** 
 
The ICF made a strategic investment in the IRIS network in summer 2018. IRISnet is positioned to provide an infrastructure for the next generation distributed business applications.  The centerpiece of IRISnet is a regional hub known as IRIS Hub that builds on top of Cosmos SDK to enable cross-chain interoperability through a unified service model.  IRISHub was  launched in March 2019.

**10. Coin Center** [**https://coincenter.org/about**](https://coincenter.org/about)

**Type of Funding: Grant**

**Category: Social Good**

**TLDR: Educating policymakers on cryptocurrencies and blockchain.**
 
Coin Center is a leading non-profit research and advocacy center focused on public policy issues facing cryptocurrency and decentralized computing technologies. Their mission is to build a better understanding of blockchain technologies and to promote a regulatory climate that preserves the freedom to innovate using permissionless blockchain technologies. Coin Center produces and publishes policy research from respected academics and experts. Their goal is to educate policymakers and the media about blockchain technology by engaging in advocacy for sound public policy.
The ICF strongly believes in educating the general public and policymakers about the importance of decentralized blockchain technologies. Unfortunately, many policymakers and regulators have not been adequately educated on these topics leaving the tax and legal systems of countries around the world to be unclear, confusing and constantly leading us to fit square pegs in round holes regarding how to treat and think about crypto. The ICF looks to support the education of government and policymakers worldwide and a small contribution to Coin Center helps us to forward this education initiative.

**Type of Funding: Grant**


**Category: Research**

**TLDR: Research on gossip protocols to improve Tendermint scalability**

The ICF made a grant to Professor Pedone’s lab at the University of Lugano. The original scope of the grant was to evaluate the software protocols to better guide scalability efforts of Tendermint, but the scope of the grant has evolved within the Lab.  The team at Pedone’s Lab is largely focused on distributed systems with a focus on gossip protocols. 
 
 
**12. Figment** [**https://hubble.figment.network**](https://hubble.figment.network)

**Type of Funding: Service Agreement**

**Category: Product**

**TLDR: A block explorer**
 
Figment was engaged through a service agreement with the ICF to build the Hubble block explorer. The ICF was excited to work with an engaged team who was willing to open source their development, and create specific features that the development teams at AIB and the ICF felt were important for the overall operation of the Cosmos Network. Hubble played an important role in Game of Stakes and other pre-launch testnets.
 
**13. Nomic Hodlings**  [**https://github.com/nomic-io/lotion**](https://github.com/nomic-io/lotion)

**Type of Funding: Service Agreement**

**Category: Engineering**

**TLDR: Bitcoin peg zone development**
 
The ICF engaged Nomic Hodlings through a service agreement to support the development of their Bitcoin peg zone. The Nomic team previously built LotionJS, a framework for building applications in javascript on top of Tendermint. They have now built a peg to bitcoin and a bitcoin sidechain written in Lotion.
 
While Javascript is a notoriously insecure language, the Nomic team is now working with Agoric to integrate Agoric’s secure javascript, SES, into their applications to enhance the security of their Bitcoin peg zone. They are a testament to the value that Cosmos may bring to the Bitcoin network. And of course, they are natural born HODLERs.

**14. Blocklayer** [**https://github.com/blocklayerhq**](https://github.com/blocklayerhq)

**Type of Funding: Service Agreement**

**Category: Engineering**

**TLDR: Tools to make the Cosmos SDK easier to use**

Blocklayer is an experienced team that was engaged through the ICF to build tools for making the Cosmos SDK more accessible.  Blocklayer built ChainKit,  a tool for building, deploying and running SDK apps. Chainkit makes it easy for developers to create a boilerplate template built on the SDK, to eliminate a significant amount of upfront work.  ChainKit packages an application in a Docker container, pushes to IPFS so it’s stored in a decentralized way, and allows anyone else using ChainKit to easily pull down the application and run it.
 
While Chainkit has added value to Cosmos, the team has now pivoted away from working in the blockchain space to focus on other use-cases.
 
**15. Lunamint**  [**https://lunamint.com/**](https://lunamint.com/)

**Type of Funding: Grant**

**Category: Community**

**TLDR: Building out the Cosmos Korea community**
 
The ICF made a grant to Lunamint to support their community development efforts in Korea. They have been publishing a weekly report on the Cosmos ecosystem ([https://medium.com/lunamint-atlas/52-week-cosmos/home](https://medium.com/lunamint-atlas/52-week-cosmos/home)), organizing meetups for the Cosmos Korea community, and are working on a Telegram app that integrates with Cosmos to enable Telegram bots and users to interact through the Cosmos network.
 
Lunamint provides a UI for staking on both the Cosmos and IRIS networks. They have launched mintscan.io which is an easy to use Cosmos block explorer. The Lunamint team is currently running a Cosmos validator, however, the granted funds were to be used only for non-validator related activities, such as community and software development.
 
**16. Open Money Initiative** [**https://www.openmoneyinitiative.org/**](https://www.openmoneyinitiative.org/)

**Type of Funding: Grant**

**Category: Social Good**

**TLDR: Conducting research on cryptocurrency use in Venezuela to understand mission critical use-cases.**
 
The ICF allocated a grant to the Open Money Initiative (OMI). OMI is an initiative to investigate and understand how blockchain technology can help people in nations where the financial infrastructure has broken down. There first research project has a specific focus on Venezuela.
 
While OMI is not directly related to Cosmos, the ICF believes in education and helping to implement the larger vision of using open and decentralized network technology to solve real-world problems and create great accessibility and opportunity for all. We believe the research conducted by OMI will help inform how other decentralized blockchain technologies can have an impact on improving the lives of people around the world. Further, the data and knowledge derived from this project have the ability to be valuable in informing product design choices in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, particularly in the area of user experience. The ICF believes that learnings from this study will help to shape and improve other cryptocurrency product development efforts.
 
To date, the team has conducted a longitudinal study that captures people's daily interactions with money in Venezuela and challenged participants to receive bitcoin and use it.
 
**17. EPFL Lausanne** [**http://lpdwww.epfl.ch/rachid/**](http://lpdwww.epfl.ch/rachid/)

**Type of Funding: Grant**

**Category: Research**

**TLDR: Research on scalable consensus mechanisms.**

Rachid Guerraoui is a professor at the University of École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne
(EPFL) who  is working on a distributed systems project that includes more scalable approaches to consensus mechanisms, specifically, disentangling parts of an application that require consensus from those that do not. Cosmos is a network of discrete blockchains, without a global consensus across all of them. Many applications that will run on Cosmos may not require consensus for all components of the application. This research has the potential to be integrated into Tendermint for higher performance and scalability.
