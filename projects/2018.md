**TLDR: Built infrastructure required for the launch of the Cosmos Network.**
 
Under a service agreement from the ICF, All in Bits has built infrastructures like Tendermint, the Cosmos-SDK, and LotionJS; it built applications like the Cosmos Hub and Ethermint using the Cosmos-SDK; it built Voyager, a wallet for the Cosmos Hub, now known as Lunie; and it designed the IBC protocol which will enable interoperability between Cosmos blockchains. It also handled the marketing of Tendermint and Cosmos products, ran hackathons and bug-bounties, managed the community, and helped dozens of other teams build on top of Tendermint and Cosmos. In March 2019 this software necessary to launch the Cosmos Network was completed and successfully used by the community to facilitate launch.
