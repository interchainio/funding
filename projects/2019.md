**18. Regen** [**https://www.regen.network/**](https://www.regen.network/)

**Type of Funding: Service Agreement**

**Category: Product**

**TLDR: Marketplace & Contracting Platform for Earth's Ecosystem Assets, also working on important SDK features.**

Regen is one of the first application-focused funding efforts of the ICF. 
Regen Network aims to build a technology platform that allows the  global community to monitor and invest in projects which have a beneficial ecological impact. The purpose of this is to more  effectively fight the global crisis of climate change, soil degradation, loss of biodiversity, etc. 

To date Regen has developed a beta version of an app for collecting data from farmers. They are currently  developing Regen Ledger - an ecology focused blockchain. 

The ICF funded this project for two main reasons; first, we felt this team had a strong mission and second, their application development efforts have helped improve general infrastructure for the SDK and Tendermint. They are early users of the SDK and provide consistent, useful feedback, have driven the development of a [major feature](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/3979) and have fixed a number of [bugs](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/3982) in the SDK. Their upstream changes to Cosmos SDK have ultimately benefited the entire community.

**Type of Funding: Grant**

**Category: Social Good**

**TLDR: Educational grants for high school students to learn about blockchain.**
 
The ICF allocated a small grant to She256, a nonprofit dedicated to increasing diversity and reducing barriers to entry in the blockchain space.  The funds went directly to supporting scholarships for Block-Change, a development bootcamps for underrepresnted high school students. 

She256 is a dedicated team interested in developing and promoting a number of different social good areas that align with the mission of the ICF. The ICF encouraged She256 to develop education programs in the blockchain community in areas such as developer workshops for Cosmos, creating blockchain curriculums and developing financial literacy education programs.
 
 
**20. Swish Labs/Thorchain** [**https://www.swishlabs.com/**](https://www.swishlabs.com/)

**Type of Funding: Service Agreement**

**Category: Engineering**

**TLDR: Building an ETH peg zone**
 
The ICF  engaged Swish Labs/Thorchain through a service agreement to develop a unidirectional Ethereum bridge with a dynamic validator set, building off the work done on Peggy by the All In Bits team to date. These bridges will ultimately unite the Cosmos and Ethereum ecosystems; providing  access to the liquid token and fee environment of Ethereum for Cosmos, and providing the rich computation framework on Cosmos to Ethereum.
 
**21. Cygni Labs** 

**Type of Funding: Service Agreement**

**Category: Engineering**

**TLDR: AI to discover bugs in Cosmos codebases**
 
Cygni Labs is working on Icarus, a project that uses deep learning/AI to discover bugs and vulnerabilities in the Cosmos codebases. The ICF allocated funding via a service agreement to Cygni Labs, as we believe that now that Cosmos has launched, the long-term success of the network rests on the robustness, quality, and security of the code. In order to ensure the robustness and quality of the code, the ICF has conducted many security audits.  Another approach to evaluating the robustness of the code is through formal verification. Icarus is yet another approach that has used cutting edge deep learning techniques to improve the Tendermint/Cosmos codebases.
 
We believe this is a long-term play in improving the process of discovering security vulnerabilities and maintaining healthy codebases.
 
**22. Agoric** [**https://agoric.com/**](https://agoric.com/)

**Type of Funding: Investment and Service Agreement** 

**Category: Engineering**

**TLDR: Pioneers in capability-based security; Inventors of secure javascript;  major contributors to IBC spec and JS implementation.**

The ICF made a strategic investment in Agoric to help grow and develop the Agoric team.
 
The Agoric team is comprised of pioneers at the intersection of markets and computation; they were some of the first to discover that secure, executable contracts form the foundation of open, decentralized network infrastructure. They invented the first object-capabilities based security systems and have been evolving them at places like Microsoft and Google ever since. The design of the Cosmos-SDK and of IBC are both heavily influenced by their work. They have recently turned their attention to Javascript.
 
The ICF also has a service agreement in place with Agoric for the purpose of working with All In Bits Inc and the ICF to merge Agoric Vat/CapTP and Cosmos IBC into a single protocol and build a smart contract execution environment that uses secure javascript and also natively can handle cross chain interaction. 
 
Additionally, the Agoric team is collaborating with Nomic Hodling (ICF funded company) to integrate their Secure ECMAScript (SES) with LotionJS.
 
Alignment with the Agoric team can help ensure that our object-capabilities design remains world class and that the Cosmos Network becomes the foundation for a new breed of secure, open and decentralized Javascript applications.
 
**23. Lunie** [**https://lunie.io/#/**](https://lunie.io/#/)

**Type of Funding: Service Agreement**

**Category: Product**

**TLDR: Cosmos wallet**

Lunie is an open source full featured Cosmos Hub wallet that will be a major entry point for users of the Cosmos Network.  The Lunie team (previously known as Voyager) worked at All in Bits Inc for 18 months, building and refactoring their wallet application atop the rapidly evolving Cosmos-SDK, before spinning out as an independent company. They are dedicated to improving the user experience of the Cosmos Network.
 
Some of the first initiatives of Lunie will be to add a dashboard and support chain selection, maintain and improve Lunie based on user feedback, prepare Lunie for use on mobile and add a chrome extension.

**24. Gitcoin** [**https://gitcoin.co/**](https://gitcoin.co/)

**Type of Funding: Grant**

**Category: Engineering**

**TLDR: A developer bounty program marketplace**
 
Gitcoin is a marketplace focused on growing FOSS and bringing FOSS developers and funders together. The ICF allocated a grant to Gitcoin; the funds are deployed via bounties on Gitcoin for Cosmos related projects. The ICF believes it is important that many teams tackle similar and overlapping aspects of Network development and aim to promote these multi-builder approaches. Gitcoin promotes engagement with the community using bounties as an engagement tool. It provides a platform and rewards for developers who are starting to experiment with the Cosmos SDK, with the goal of translating that initial interaction into a long term relationship. Ultimately, these kinds of engagement tools will help Cosmos scale by focusing on bugs and new designs faster, as well as help acquire and maintain a network of long-term contributors.  
 
 
**25. Confio** [**https://github.com/ethanfrey**](https://github.com/ethanfrey)

**Type of Funding: Service Agreement**

**Category: Engineering**

**TLDR:A generic protobuf format for IBC to encode merkle proofs from a range of data stores.** 

Confio was contracted by the ICF to build a generic protobuf format for IBC to encode merkle proofs from a range of data stores. The format Confio is building  will allow IBC to be general enough to describe many different types of merkle trees; Tendermint’s IAVL+ tree, Nomic’s AVL tree, and Ethereum’s Patricia tree. 

**26. ChainSafe**  [**https://chainsafe.io/**](https://chainsafe.io/)

**Type of Funding: Service Agreement**

**Category: Engineering**

**TLDR: Building Ethermint**

ChainSafe is a grassroots team of Toronto developers who are engaged by the ICF to build Ethermint. ChainSafe will work with members of the All In Bits team on the implementation.  
Ethermint is the high speed implementation of Ethereum built on top of Tendermint. Go Ethereum can be  slow and doesn’t offer transaction finality due to Ethereum’s Proof-of-Work security model. Ethermint will give the same ability to deploy smart contracts at a much faster speed. 
ChainSafe will be implementing the EVM as a CosmosSDK module, allowing the Ethermint EVM to interact with other Cosmos SDK modules. 

**27. Supranational** [**https://www.supranational.net/**](https://www.supranational.net/)

**Type of Funding: Grant**

**Category: Engineering**

**TLDR: Open source VDF (Verifiable Delay Function) hardware**

Supranational is focused on algorithm and hardware acceleration, and is currently developing open source hardware for fast verifiable delay functions. The VDF project is potentially one of the most important pieces of public infrastructure that the blockchain space will produce, it is infrastructure that will be used for the benefit of many blockchain projects as well as the industry more generally. The ICF believes that involvement in this project is a contribution to both the Cosmos Network as well as blockchain ecosystem in general. 

**28. Proof of Stake Alliance** [**https://www.proofofstakealliance.org/**](https://www.proofofstakealliance.org/)

**Type of Funding: Grant**

**Category: Social Good** 

**TLDR: A consortium of leading industry stakeholders that are promoting positive dialogue with regulators and policymakers around PoS protocols.**

The ICF allocated a grant to become a member of the Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA). The goal of POSA is to engage and educate regulators on the benefits of PoS technologies to help guide the new regulatory environment and ensure it accurately reflects the nature of the system and technology. The ICF believes that POSA will play an important role in helping shape the conversations and regulations around PoS networks. We support these educational efforts, as they will benefit the entire PoS community and set an example for countries around the world looking for regulatory guidance on PoS.  

**29. FOAM** [**https://foam.space/**](https://foam.space/)

**Type of Funding: Service Agreement** 

**Category: Engineering**

**TLDR: Creating open source, production level ABCI server, libraries, and a base SDK layer for developing Tendermint backed applications in Haskell.** 

The goal of this project is for the FOAM and Kadena (see below) teams to work together to deliver a Tendermint SDK in Haskell, integration with Kadena’s Pact runtime, and IBC support. FOAM is working on creating a production ready ABCI Server in Haskell, a BaseApp library in Haskell and a tutorial and Basecoin app in Haskell, compatible with the Basecoin app in the Cosmos-SDK. The ICF is excited about this initiative given the importance of developing SDK support in new languages such as Haskell. Further,  given Haskell is an advanced functional language with strong guarantees, this will open up opportunities  for users that require significant assurance in their code to engage with the SDK.  

**30. Kadena** [**https://kadena.io/en/**](https://kadena.io/en/)

**Type of Funding: Service Agreement**

**Category: Engineering**

**TLDR: Integrating Pact, Kadena’s FOSS smart contract language, with Tendermint, and provide in-language support for IBC.**

As above, the high level goal of this project is for the Kadena and FOAM teams to work together to deliver a Tendermint SDK in Haskell, integration with the Pact runtime, and IBC support. Kadena will work on research and design of Pact integration layer with IBC support, implementing Pact runtime with the FOAM-built SDK interfaces and integrating and completing a Pact Tendermint Component.  Pact is Kadena’s smart contract language written in Haskell. Given Tendermint itself doesn’t define an applications, integration with Pact will bring a smart contract virtual machine to Tendermint. 

**31. AirGap** [**https://airgap.it/**](https://airgap.it/)

**Type of Funding: Service Agreement**

**Category: Product** 

**TLDR: Mobile wallet with unique two device approach for security and useability** 

AirGap is a blockchain agnostic crypto wallet with a unique two device approach that enhances both security and usability. Airgap’s product enables users to easily increase security using an air gapped approach to managing, transacting, bonding and participating in governance using their ATOMs in AirGap.
