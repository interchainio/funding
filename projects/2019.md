**Type of Funding: Service Agreement**

**Category: Product**

**TLDR: Marketplace & Contracting Platform for Earth's Ecosystem Assets, also working on important SDK features.**

Regen is one of the first application-focused funding efforts of the ICF. 
Regen Network aims to build a technology platform that allows the  global community to monitor and invest in projects which have a beneficial ecological impact. The purpose of this is to more  effectively fight the global crisis of climate change, soil degradation, loss of biodiversity, etc. 

To date Regen has developed a beta version of an app for collecting data from farmers. They are currently  developing Regen Ledger - an ecology focused blockchain. 

The ICF funded this project for two main reasons; first, we felt this team had a strong mission and second, their application development efforts have helped improve general infrastructure for the SDK and Tendermint. They are early users of the SDK and provide consistent, useful feedback, have driven the development of a [major feature](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/3979) and have fixed a number of [bugs](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/3982) in the SDK. Their upstream changes to Cosmos SDK have ultimately benefited the entire community.

**21. Cygni Labs** 

**Type of Funding: Service Agreement**

**Category: Engineering**

**TLDR: AI to discover bugs in Cosmos codebases**
 
Cygni Labs is working on Icarus, a project that uses deep learning/AI to discover bugs and vulnerabilities in the Cosmos codebases. The ICF allocated funding via a service agreement to Cygni Labs, as we believe that now that Cosmos has launched, the long-term success of the network rests on the robustness, quality, and security of the code. In order to ensure the robustness and quality of the code, the ICF has conducted many security audits.  Another approach to evaluating the robustness of the code is through formal verification. Icarus is yet another approach that has used cutting edge deep learning techniques to improve the Tendermint/Cosmos codebases.
 
We believe this is a long-term play in improving the process of discovering security vulnerabilities and maintaining healthy codebases.
 
**22. Agoric** [**https://agoric.com/**](https://agoric.com/)

**Type of Funding: Investment and Service Agreement** 

**Category: Engineering**

**TLDR: Pioneers in capability-based security; Inventors of secure javascript;  major contributors to IBC spec and JS implementation.**

The ICF made a strategic investment in Agoric to help grow and develop the Agoric team.
 
The Agoric team is comprised of pioneers at the intersection of markets and computation; they were some of the first to discover that secure, executable contracts form the foundation of open, decentralized network infrastructure. They invented the first object-capabilities based security systems and have been evolving them at places like Microsoft and Google ever since. The design of the Cosmos-SDK and of IBC are both heavily influenced by their work. They have recently turned their attention to Javascript.
 
The ICF also has a service agreement in place with Agoric for the purpose of working with All In Bits Inc and the ICF to merge Agoric Vat/CapTP and Cosmos IBC into a single protocol and build a smart contract execution environment that uses secure javascript and also natively can handle cross chain interaction. 
 
Additionally, the Agoric team is collaborating with Nomic Hodling (ICF funded company) to integrate their Secure ECMAScript (SES) with LotionJS.
 
Alignment with the Agoric team can help ensure that our object-capabilities design remains world class and that the Cosmos Network becomes the foundation for a new breed of secure, open and decentralized Javascript applications.
